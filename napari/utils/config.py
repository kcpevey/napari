Experimental Features

Async Loading
-------------
Deprecated. This was used by the old async slicing which was tied to octree.
There was logic in this file which the old async required. The new async
slicing has now been implemented and does not require the extra logic. It
can be turned on via the UI (with no restart) or via the environment
variable NAPARI_ASYNC=1.

Octree Rendering
----------------
Deprecated. Octree was deprecated in the v0.5 release. A new version of async
slicing without octree is now available via the Experimental settings UI or the
environment variable NAPARI_ASYNC=1.

Shared Memory Server
--------------------
Experimental shared memory service. Only enabled if NAPARI_MON is set to
the path of a config file. See this PR for more info:
https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/1909.
